■ Description<br />
Predict the price of a used car. You are given a dataset on 40,000 used cars. The data describes each car based on its features and its condition.<br />
■ Goal<br />
Construct a model to predict sale price of a used car based on its features and condition and use it to generate predictions for a set of unlabeled data.<br />
